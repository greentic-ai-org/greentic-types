PR: Greentic-types alignment to canonical 0.6.0 contracts (no duplication)

Context
- The Greentic ecosystem is converging to a single contract line: component@0.6.x and types-core@0.6.x.
- greentic-interfaces is the ONLY source of truth for WIT + schemas for 0.6.
- greentic-types must NOT define any WIT or duplicate types; it must generate types/bindings from the canonical WIT and provide CBOR encode/decode helpers.

Goals
1) Lockstep dependency:
   - Pin greentic-types to the canonical greentic-interfaces revision that contains `wit/greentic/**@0.6.0/**`.
   - Use a workspace path or git rev override so host+component builds always use the same WIT.

2) Bindings generation:
   - Add/update build.rs (or existing bindgen pipeline) to generate Rust bindings from the canonical WIT packages:
     - greentic:types-core@0.6.0
     - greentic:component/component@0.6.0
   - Ensure there are NO `wit/` source files in greentic-types for 0.6.
   - Ensure generated outputs are deterministic (stable paths, stable filenames).
   - Decide whether generated code is checked in or build-generated; if checked in, add CI to verify it matches generation.

3) CBOR-first types:
   - Provide Rust structs that represent the canonical core types (TenantCtx, IDs, InvocationEnvelope, InvocationResult, errors).
   - Provide encode/decode functions to/from CBOR bytes:
     - payload_cbor and metadata_cbor remain bytes at the protocol boundary
     - for common internal structs (TenantCtx etc.), add CBOR codec helpers.
   - Use a fast CBOR crate (e.g. ciborium) and avoid JSON serde in the 0.6 protocol path.
   - Add minimal round-trip tests:
     - serialize -> deserialize for TenantCtx / InvocationEnvelope shapes
     - stable ordering / deterministic encoding where relevant (document what is guaranteed).

4) CI gates
   - Add a CI step that:
     - builds greentic-types
     - ensures it compiles against the pinned greentic-interfaces contracts
     - (optional) verifies there is only one version of greentic-interfaces/types-core in cargo tree.

Non-goals
- Do not modify contracts in greentic-interfaces from this repo.
- Do not create new WIT packages here.
- Do not “fix” mismatches by editing local copies; mismatches must be solved by pinning to the same contracts.

Acceptance criteria
- `cargo test` passes in greentic-types.
- There are no WIT source files for 0.6 in this repo.
- Bindings compile and match the canonical greentic-interfaces WIT.
- CBOR helpers exist for core types and have round-trip tests.

Deliverables
- build.rs / generation pipeline
- dependency pinning to greentic-interfaces rev
- Rust types + CBOR codecs + tests
- update .codex/repo_overview.md pre+post and run ci/local_check.sh

Do not ask for permission; implement end-to-end.
