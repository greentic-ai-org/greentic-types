# Vision: Canonical v0.6

This folder defines the documentation contract for `greentic-types`.

- Canonical path only: [`canonical-v0.6.md`](canonical-v0.6.md)
- Compatibility and legacy surfaces: [`legacy.md`](legacy.md)
- Deprecation signals and replacements: [`deprecations.md`](deprecations.md)

Rule:

- New work should target the canonical v0.6 contract.
- Legacy surfaces remain only for migration and should not be used for new designs.
